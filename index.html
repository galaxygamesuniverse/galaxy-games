        The year is 2108, Earth as you knew it no longer exists. The great floods of 2099 destroyed most of civilisation. Mad Max was wrong, it wasn&#39;t the scarcity of water, but the scarcity of land that destroyed civilization. Two years earlier, through good fortune, or higher powers at work, Fran Cox and her team of scientists working with Hubble VI discovered seven planets that could sustain life. Sensing this opportunity to fulfil a lifelong ambition to colonise other planets, big dreamer Dion Fusk launched seven groups of hardy travellers (selected at random) to the furthest outreaches of the galaxy. The planets, all different in size, atmosphere and liveability (some are much more hospitable than others) now house the only known remnants of the human species. And still the only known life in our galaxy. If you are reading this, you are one of the few that are still alive. The future of humanity rests on your shoulders.

          In the weeks before the seven groups departure Cox and her team of astronomers discovered an eighth inhabitable planet in the same corner of the galaxy. Early indications suggested The Eighth Ball was almost perfect in atmospheric conditions to sustain human life. Temperatures ranged from blazing hot during the day to icy cold at night but all within a reasonable range. Mostly covered in huge sand dunes, but with plenty of water and rich soil it was fertile enough for crops. Scientists likened conditions to North Africa on Earth around the time of the millenium. </br>However, with seven multi-year courses already plotted and without the ability to mobilise another transport rocket (or team) at such short notice, it was decided this would remain an emergency outpost should life became unsustainable on any of the Seven Heavens. That didn&#39;t occur, through the same ingenuity and resilience that humans had displayed over tens of thousands of years on Earth, each group managed to forge a life, of sorts, for themselves. Sensing an opportunity to create a utopian existence it was decreed that a galaxy-wide competition would be held to decide which of the groups could live on The Eighth Ball and set about creating a new long-term home for humanity to exist. A rebirth for the species on a planet with the closet conditions to Earth. Some may wonder what&#39;s the use of saving life when you see what we do with it, but this is about forging a new way. A new world. A better world. A world where there isn&#39;t tension between rich and poor, house and techno, technology and man. </br> Welcome to The Galaxy Games.

      <p class="content-header">Galaxy Games</p>
      <br>
        <p class="content-body">
          Inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, Earth from the 8th century BC to the 21st century AD the Galaxy Games are held every four years. The winning team of the Galaxy Games is entitled to live on The Eighth Ball for one Olympiad. Like the Olympics on earth, these games require great skills and courage. It is one shot, every four years, at a better life. For some, it will mean the difference between life and death. The next Galaxy Games takes place one month from today. You are expected to arrive with your team and compete. It will test your mind, body, unity. For the winners it is four years of living in Earth-like paradise and shaping a future society built on love, compassion and care for your fellow humans. For everyone else, it is back to the Seven Heavens were you will survive, but not much else. Your future is in your hands. </br>See you in the colosseum.
